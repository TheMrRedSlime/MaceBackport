# MaceBackport

This is a mace backport plugin i added since i didnt find anything good on spigot/modrinth.
This dosent use the same formula, but takes the fallDistance variable as a base. Still does good damage.
You can right click as a special ability to launch yourself in the air
It also has a crafting recipe, shown here.

It supports version 1.13-1.21 and onwards i believe.
